# html2fritz2-plugin
An Intellij plugin to copy/paste from HTML to fritz2 DSL.

Derived from [kotlinx.html-plugin](https://github.com/data2viz/kotlinx.html-plugin)

This plugin simplifies the transformation of HTML code to a fritz2-project 
by automatically doing the conversion during a copy/paste.
